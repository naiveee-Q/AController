# AController

I gained some inspiration from the project I found in the last class that used only cardboards and existing controllers to create new input with better experience. And I watched a video of a player with only one hand who played Monster Hunter: Rise pretty well. So my project is to design a new input form using only one hand based on current controllers I have. To make it easier, my first choice is to use joy cons of Nintendo Switch and cardboard.

My design is more like the control stick of the flights. With buttons on a joystick. So the players wonâ€™t use two fingers separately to control dimension and movement at the same time. And with the other buttons along the joystick, it will be easier to reach with the remaining four fingers.

After trying the joy cons, I found it hard to control these buttons on it from the surface of handle. I then turned for the Ardity kit we used on the previous lesson. 4 buttons and the joy stick of the kit are successfully connected to Unity and the problem happened on handcrafting. A smaller breadboard is used to put the buttons inside the handle. But I can't use the handle to control the joy stick like I used to do with the joy cons. The joy stick of the Ardity kit is tiny and made of metal, which means I can't simply glue it to a larger stick or use the same trick before to control.

I shall find special glues for the joy stick or some other ways to connect it to the handle. I may try for the 3D printer once I get any chances.
